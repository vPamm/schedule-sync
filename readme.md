A "simple" script that will login to a Microsoft Office account, then redirect to a Kronos schedule, scrape it, then export all the shifts to seperate .ics files to be uploaded to a nextcloud or radicale calendar.

Must add your own links and everything.

Will output a log and take screenshots of the current screens in case something goes wrong (runs in a headless window)

Setup script is to get it running on Linux, useful if you want to run it in a proxmox vm.
